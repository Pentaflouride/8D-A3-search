Reference 8D ES 191216231144 for detailed analysis of root cause hypotheses of design robustness RCH2 - Deka 10 design and process variation introduces inherent variability, resulting in isolated occurrences dynamic lean shift observation Why does dynamic lean shift occur in a percentage of the test population? Dynamic lean shift occurs due to an increase in opening time, and variation in opening time is seen part to part Why does opening time variation occur? Opening time variation is a resultant of variation in wear severity at the sealing interface Why is variation seen in ball to seat sealing band wear? Wear variation is a resultant of design robustness sensitivity to design and process parameter variation Why was variation of design and process parameters influence on dynamic shift not captured in Deka 10 CTG 8D S180711224450? Overall variation in small controlled builds not captured, resulting in small occurrence of flow shift being observed outside of the defined specification due to sensitivity and lack of robustness against the stack-up

outputs
RCH2 - Deka 10 design and process variation introduces inherent variability, resulting in isolated occurrences of dynamic lean shift
observation. Dynamic lean shift occurs due to an increase in opening time, and variation inopening time is seen part to part. Opening
time variation is a resultant of variation in wear severity at the sealing interface.

inputs

1. Review of defined dynamic tolerance vs system sensitivity to absolute flow (flow shift from nominal) compared to testing definition of shift from baseline. Resp. NCS, Status: Complete -> +8% shift from nominal capability (slide 15) 2. Determine injector flow shift capability in test bench RSG E-10 mechanical durability from nominal vs. baseline, Resp. J. Hatfield, Status: Complete - +8% from nominal results in capability of CpK = 1.27 (slide 16) Upper Limit Lower Limit CpK Test Samples Out of Spec Shift from Baseline Shift from Nominal

AMC PV6 (L062-05) PV8 (L113-03) and PV9 (L209-03, L209-04) were analyzed for dynamic flow shift from nominal while introducing end of test line variability to determine the product robustness vs. system sensitivity to absolute flow. The analysis shows a capability of 1.27 to the allowable flow shift defined by the Non-Auto system integration team

Components/systems analysis: TFM/System: Drop of pressure partly reproduceable at RBG testbench since 28.09.2018, but pressure values are still in tolerance and therefore the system leaktest is passed. During this test only the returned TFM was used and therefore the rootcause could be located to the TFM module.

Alignment with customer is to increase the current test pressure of 5.5bar to 6.5bar (Daimler Setup). Software validation performed and passed. Calibration data was sent 20thof November. BMW internal tests ongoing. Software is planned to be implemented with next I-Step 1430 (active: 07/2019, data freeze: 28.11.2018).

Software validation performed and passed. For the evaluation six failed (rejected by customer) and 21 new pumps were used. Results are shown in separate file. Software update in place since I-Step 19-3-510. Monitoring since several months showed a significant decrease of failures (less than 1 percent one car) over all BMW closed by customer. Passive monitoring ongoing on customer site.
