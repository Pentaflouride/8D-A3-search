30,"Trigger is ""anti jerk"" function that activates flash protection and it is not possible to reprogram the ECU Only D-samples (serial parts) are affected. Some flash containers of SW version B86 to B88 show this behavior (BMW stated). Continental analysis of the various effected vehicle variants (e.g.: RR4 US BB / RR5 US / RR6 US BB) gave a hint to some special calibration data variant (activation of anti jerk function). BMW confirmed this finding with a crosscheck (deactivation of anti jerk function) in an affected calibration variant. To understand the root cause debugging of a D-sample ECU is necessary. A new ECU with Lauterbach access has to be built up for debugging. A changed S-Boot is necessary for debugger access. Switch is necessary to disable the Monitoring Unit (MU) and the Watchdog (WD). Debugging showed an issue that occurs due to copy process of the flash memory which is necessary for application ECUs but not for serial ECU samples. This process caused an Single Cycle Resume Command, which enables the Flash Protection. Therefore at least on one of the four addresses A0045554 / A0055554 A0065554 / A0075554 must have the value ""5E"" so that the flash protection is activated. One of these four addresses is used by the anti jerk function.",Only D-samples (serial parts) are affected. Some flash containers of SW version B86 to B88 show this behavior.
