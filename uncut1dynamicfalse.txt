TARGET CONDITION: Twenty four of twenty-four injectors successfully pass test bench mechanical durability per S1297 in RSG E-10

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: RCH2 - Deka 10 design and process variation introduces inherent variability, resulting in isolated occurrences of dynamic lean shift observation. Dynamic lean shift occurs due to an increase in opening time. Opening time variation is a resultant of variation in wear severity at the sealing interface.

COUNTERMEASURES: Review of defined dynamic tolerance vs system sensitivity to absolute flow. Determine injector flow shift capability in test bench RSG E-10 mechanical durability.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Spray angle ranging from 36,7° to 69,0°O PV parts (spec allow 70°+25°)

CURRENT CONDITION: Out of specification spray angle for DDU transfer PV parts, Specification allows 70°+25°, parts observed as low as 36° Situation pertains to both GM and H

TARGET CONDITION: All parts produced within 70°+25° specification

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Supplier change for DDU lower housing (LH) (NPN components Texeido) and obsolete machinery used to produce the part resulted in the update of certain LH print dimensions to reduce leak failures. This resulted in a valve that was more recessed inside the LH than normal NPN production parts.
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Supplier change for DDU lower housing (LH) (NPN components Texeido) and obsolete machinery used to produce the part resulted in the update of certain LH print dimensions to reduce leak failures. This resulted in a valve that was more recessed inside the LH than normal NPN production parts.

COUNTERMEASURES: Reducing the amount the valve was recessed was found to mitigate the risk of cone angle of spec. The final nominal value chosen was between the production maximum recessed value and the Loop 1 minimum Recessed value (actual values below)
