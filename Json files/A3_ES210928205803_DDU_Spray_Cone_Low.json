This resulted in a valve that was more recessed inside the LH than normal NPN production parts and the risk of having some parts out of spec for spray cone angle. )These parts are identified as Loop 1) This issue was able to be turned on and off by varying the amount by which the valve was", "COUNTERMEASURES": "Reducing the amount the valve was recessed was found to mitigate the risk of cone angle of spec while also avoiding the risk of leak failures. The final nominal value chosen was between the production maximum recessed value and the Loop 1 minimum recessed value (actual values below).
