Habold MUC). There're no specific OBD failure code. The failure appears after first SCR system initiation (F1_Test). Failed at test step: System leak test.

After some minutes the test can be repeated without the failure. BMW decided to send the cars out. Just one system affected were the second test was also not ok. this system will be send to RGB.", "TARGET CONDITION": "Failure root cause has to be understood and failure occurrence has to be eliminated. Target is to bring F1_testfails to zero % at customer plants", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "Components/systems analysis: TFM/System: Drop of pressure partly reproduceable at RBG testbench since 28.09.2018, but pressure values are still in tolerance and therefore the system leaktest is passed. During this test only the returned TFM was used and therefore the rootcause could be located to the TFM module.
