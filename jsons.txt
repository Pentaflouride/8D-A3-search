TARGET CONDITION: Goal is to analyze the ECU hardware and the affected B88 software and the calibration data to fix both issues (immobilizer sync & reprogramming).
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Some flash containers of SW version B86 to B88 show this behavior. Trigger is "anti jerk" function that activates flash protection and it is not possible to reprogram the ECU Only D-samples (serial parts) are affected.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sporadic CAN frame dropouts existing in Pre-SW-versions of SE1500. This leads to a sporadic dropout of Message ESP21
CURRENT CONDITION: Sporadic CAN frame dropouts existing in Pre-SW-versions of SE1 Delivery of SW SE1500 to customer VW stopped
TARGET CONDITION: Identify the root cause of CAN frame / ESP21 dropouts and the location of the failure (VT side or VW side) If failure is on VT side define timing for problem solution
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:  Debugging Session identifies that the restbus simulation, delivery from customer VW, is the main root cause for toggling of the ESP_21 Message. In the regular/correct case would be here that a message transfer every 20ms is present.
COUNTERMEASURES: The failure is caused by VW Restbus simulation. A syncronisation with Customer will take place in regular "Technikrunde" on 18.03.2022. Tracking is done via VW ASG 2.2 Project PAIL Al #182.
