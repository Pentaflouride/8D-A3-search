PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WO# K150-08, Deka 10 TP1008 DV dynamic lean shift. failure observed In RSG E-10 test bench
CURRENT CONDITION: 200M. Audit 47362 = -10.1%. 47371 = -6.2%. 47384 = - 6.1%. 300M. audit 4742 2= -5.7%. 47421 = -3
TARGET CONDITION: Fourteen of twenty-four injectors successfully pass test bench mechanical durability per S1297 in RSG E-10.
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: RCH2 - Deka 10. design and process. variation introduces inherent variability, resulting in isolated occurrences
COUNTERMEASURES: Test bench RSG E-10: mechanical durability from nominal vs baseline. Resp J Hatfield: Status Complete
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: AMC PV6 (L062-05), PV8 (L113-03) and PV9 (L209-03, L209-04) were analyzed for dynamic flow shift
FOLLOW UP ACTION: Reference 8D- ES191216231144 for follow-up actions
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: BMW complained. first issues: 07/2018 (19.07.) @plant Dingolfing (Hr Habold, MUC). There's no specific OBD failure code
CURRENT CONDITION: All BMW plants (using SCR systems) are infected, also all variants. After some minutes the test can be repeated without the failure
TARGET CONDITION: The aim is to bring F1_testfails to zero per cent at customer plants
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: TFM/System: Drop of pressure partly reproduceable at RBG testbench since 28.09.2018, but pressure values are still in tolerance and therefore the system leaktest is passed
COUNTERMEASURES: Software validation performed and passed. Calibration data was sent 20thof November. BMW internal tests ongoing
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: Software validation performed and passed. For the evaluation six failed (rejected by customer) and 21 new pumps were used
FOLLOW UP ACTION: CNNcom will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of New York for next week
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: HMMA QC reported that '5' instead of 'D' was displayed for the select lever. switch information via UDS: $22
CURRENT CONDITION: Current $01A0 in UDS $22. service D is defined by '5' Lever Switch Displayed via GDS. before changing
TARGET CONDITION: Customer requirement delivered at Nu ATK project $01A0 in UDS $22
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: In Nu ATK CVT Spec was only SWCN canceled
COUNTERMEASURES: System requirement review based on customer requirement will be performed, and this strategy was shared throughout the meeting
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: The select lever position information via UDS $22 is normally displayed as "D" with modified SW (6VA610)
FOLLOW UP ACTION: Yokoten will deliver to further project via UDS test method with GDS mobile.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Injectors mechanically inoperable after 400 cycles of thermal shock. functional issues noted since 100 cycles
CURRENT CONDITION: Deka 7: transfer for CGQ Thermal Shock test S1331 500 Shocks
TARGET CONDITION: Product functionality remains post air-air thermal shock testing. Product functionality remains after air- air thermal shock test.
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Injector M085K27336 was sumberged in n-Heptane for 24 hours. Post soak injector returned to nominal flow values
COUNTERMEASURES: Create Procedure/Instruction document for Cell 9, including statements about o-ring lube application
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: Thermal exposure of sample of n-Heptane from Cell 9 to verify removal of orange/brown residue-causing contaminant- Resp B Hindman, due 6 May 2022
FOLLOW UP ACTION: Change test fluid/filter in cell 9 (after test above): Resp J Copeland COMPLETE 3/14/2022
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: BMW (Rolls Royce) communicated an issue. @plant Goodwood. Problem only with D-sample ECU together with 18-07-530 B88
CURRENT CONDITION: Only SW variants which have an activated anti jerk function are affected. BMW Customer part#: 9453018-01 (SW 9SP9B88S) Upd
TARGET CONDITION: Goal is to analyze the ECU hardware and the affected B88 software and the calibration data to fix both issues.
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Some flash containers of SW version B86 to B88 show this behavior. Trigger is "anti jerk" function that activates flash protection and it is not possible to reprogram the ECU
COUNTERMEASURES: All MSD87 12 cylinder SW variants since 2005 (SOP) are affected with this issue. B88 with calibration workaround already done by BMW on13th of July
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: addresses A0045554 / A0055554 - A0065554 - A0075554 must have the value "5E" - Check of ECU returns from customer BMW caused by a flash lock during end of line test.
FOLLOW UP ACTION: 21.08: C00 SW is replacing B88 in all car variants. - C00 Software update planned for 31st of July
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: O PV parts (spec allow 70°+25°) Spray angle ranging from 36,7° to 69,0°.
CURRENT CONDITION: Out of specification. spray angle for DDU transfer PV parts. Specification allows 70°+25° parts observed as low as 36°
TARGET CONDITION: All parts produced within 70°+25° specification. All parts produced in accordance with 70°-25° specifications.
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Supplier change for DDU lower housing (LH) (NPN components- Texeido) and obsolete machinery used to produce the part resulted in the update of certain LH print dimensions to reduce leak failures
COUNTERMEASURES: Reducing the amount the valve was recessed was found to mitigate the risk of cone angle of spec
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: 100% of parts passed PV Loop 2, with results equivalent to production parts from NPN

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CAF CQ3 found one piece injector stuck open during vehicle testing. Chips from VB found in the seat sealing area after tear down injector.
CURRENT CONDITION: CNNcom will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of New York for next week
TARGET CONDITION: A. Confirm the root cause in supplier side and implement prevention action in production line
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: One pcs of debug part was mixed into good parts by debug technician. Cause 2: Incorrect the length of drilling tool during debug Repeat the same failure mode with incorrect length 53
COUNTERMEASURES: Supplier: add error-proof dedicated fixture to fix the length of tool with correct position
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: Trial run: 10pcs chip samples and 50pcs normal part to verify the brush performance, 200% visual inspection in supplier side and last one month with safe launch
FOLLOW UP ACTION: The visual defect lesson learn into PFMEA. Expand the this lesson learn to other VB supplier.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sporadic CAN frame dropouts existing in Pre-SW-versions of SE1500.. This leads to a sporadic dropout of Message ESP21 and triggers toggling of vs SAE
CURRENT CONDITION: Cannibalization of VW's SW SE1500 has stopped. Sporadic CAN frame dropouts existing in Pre-SW-versions of SE1 stopped.
TARGET CONDITION: Identify the root cause of CAN frame / ESP21 dropouts and the location of the failure (VT side or VW side)
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Debugging Session identifies that the restbus simulation delivery from customer VW is the main root cause for toggling of the ESP_21 Message
COUNTERMEASURES: The failure is caused by VW Restbus simulation. A syncronisation with Customer will take place in regular "Technikrunde" on 18
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: IMS Issue 14600526 will be used for documentation of all performed actions
FOLLOW UP ACTION: The failure is fully triggered/caused by VW Restbus simulation. As there are no technical problems in VT deliverables, a lessons learned on VT side could not be performed
