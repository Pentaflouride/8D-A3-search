PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sporadic CAN frame dropouts existing in Pre-SW-versions of SE1500
CURRENT CONDITION: I am the son of a former president of the United States of America
TARGET CONDITION: Identify the root cause of CAN frame / ESP21 dropouts and the location of the failure (VT side or VW side)
ROOT CAUSE: Debugging Session identifies that the restbus simulation
COUNTERMEASURES: The failure is caused by VW Restbus simulation
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: As there are no technical problems in VT deliverables
FOLLOW UP ACTION: The failure is fully triggered/caused by VW Restbus simulation


PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Deka 7 transfer for CGQ Thermal Shock test S1331 500 Shocks
CURRENT CONDITION: Injectors mechanically inoperable after 400 cycles of thermal shock
TARGET CONDITION: Product functionality remains post air-air thermal shock testing
ROOT CAUSE: Injector M085K27336 was sumberged in n-Heptane for 24 hours
COUNTERMEASURES: Create Procedure/Instruction document for Cell 9 including statements about o-ring lube application
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: Thermal exposure of sample of n-Heptane from Cell 9 to verify removal of orange/brown residue-causing contaminant
FOLLOW UP ACTION: Change test fluid/filter in cell 9 (after test above)


PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: HMMA QC reported that '5' instead of 'D' was displayed for the select lever
CURRENT CONDITION: Current $01A0 in UDS $22 service D is defined by '5' Lever Switch Displayed via GDS before changing
TARGET CONDITION: Customer requirement delivered at Nu ATK project $01A0 in UDS $22
ROOT CAUSE: In Nu ATK CVT Spec was only SWCN canceled
COUNTERMEASURES: UDS $22 & $2F service spec will be reviewed with customer requirement even the project is not pilot
EFFECT CONFIRMATION: The select lever position information via UDS $22 is normally displayed as "D" with modified SW (6VA610) 7
FOLLOW UP ACTION: Yokoten will deliver to further project via UDS test method with GDS mobile
