TARGET CONDITION: Twenty four of twenty-four injectors successfully pass test bench mechanical durability per S1297 in RSG E-10

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: RCH2 - Deka 10 design and process variation introduces inherent variability, resulting in isolated occurrences dynamic lean shift observation. Dynamic lean shift occurs due to an increase in opening time, and variation inopening time is seen part to part.
