ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:  Debugging showed an issue that occurs due to copy process of the flash memory. This is necessary for application ECUs but not for serial ECU samples. The issue was caused by the copy process being used to write to flash memory, not to serial memory. The problem was fixed by restarting the device and re-writing the code.
